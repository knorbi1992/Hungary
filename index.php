        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <!-- Emphasized Paragraph -->
        <p class="emphasized">
            Hungary is a country situated in the Carpathian Basin in Central Europe. The capital city is Budapest. The country is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Schengen Area. Hungary has an area of 93,093 square kilometers with an estimated population of 9,879,000.
        </p>

        <h2>Government</h2>
        <p>
            Hungary is a democratic republic where members of parliament are elected every four years. The Prime Minister serves as the head of government and the President of the Republic serves as the head of state.
        </p>

        <h2>Parliament</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
        <p>The layout of the Parliament is completely symmetrical, as the building was built for a bicameral parliament in 1896. The upper house was located in the northern wing, and the meeting room of the lower house was located in the southern wing. The two meeting rooms are mirror images of each other. Today, the lower house hall is used for parliamentary meetings, the upper house hall is open to tourists, and faction meetings, conferences, and receptions are held there. It is interesting that the floor carpet in the lounge in the lower house is red, but in the upper house, it is blue, since the members of the upper house were traditionally nobles, who were called blue-blooded.</p>

    <p>The Parliament House is one of Budapest's best-known public buildings, the seat of the Hungarian Parliament and some of its institutions (such as the Parliamentary Library). It is located in the V. district of Budapest, on the left bank of the Danube, on Kossuth Lajos tér. Although the name "Parliament" is common in the common parlance for the building, this is actually the unofficial name of the body that sits there, the National Assembly, of foreign origin.</p>
